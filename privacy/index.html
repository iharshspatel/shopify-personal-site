        </div>
        <div id="purpose" class="mb-7">
            <h4>2. Purpose and legal basis of processing Personal Data</h4>
            <p>This Privacy Policy sets out the essential details relating to your Personal Data relationships with Shop Sync as a website visitor, end-user of the Shop Sync cloud-based Service, prospective client, job applicant, or contractor. Shop Sync may use Personal Data collected through its website and Shop Sync cloud-based Service primarily for the purposes of providing Service and support to users, improving the website and Service, including tailoring it to users’ preferences, providing users with product or Service updates, promotional notices, and offers, and other information about Shop Sync, responding to your questions inquiries, comments, and instructions, maintaining the security and integrity of its systems.</p>
            <h3>2.1. Processing for the purpose of contract performance and fulfillment of legal obligations</h3>
            <p>Customers contract using Shop Sync Service and give access to their employees and other third parties, as solely decided by them, by creating users who access Shop Sync Service with their email addresses and credentials. Shop Sync provides customers with its Service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Shop Sync Terms of Service, accessible at <a href="https://Shop Sync/terms.html">https://Shop Sync/terms.html</a>.</p>
            <p>Please note that under the contract, you may receive emails with technical and operational notices regarding the Shop Sync Service functionality. These notices are part of Shop Sync’s communication with you as a party to the contract. The purpose and legal basis of the processing of your Personal Data, in this case, therefore, involves the performance of the Shop Sync Service contract. Such emails do not constitute “direct marketing,” and you may not opt-out of them.</p>
            <p>The legal basis for processing, in this case, is Art. 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (“General Data Protection Regulation”).</p>
            <p>Shop Sync also needs to process this kind of Personal Data to fulfill its other legal duties. Under several laws (e.g., tax and accounting laws), Shop Sync has to process Personal Data stipulated above. The legal basis, in this case, is Art. 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
            <h3>2.2. Processing of Personal Data from requests to Shop Sync customer support service</h3>
            <p>When you contact Shop Sync customer support service, Shop Sync may use the provided Personal Data for mutual communication and pre-contractual negotiations.</p>
            <p>By contacting Shop Sync customer support service, you agree to further cooperation based on mutual communication and that your Personal Data will be processed on the basis of fulfillment of contractual obligations under Art. (6)(1)(b) of General Data Protection Regulation. Otherwise, Shop Sync will only process personal data for the purposes of dealing with your inquiries and requests based on the legitimate interest of ensuring mutual communication under Art. (6)(1)(f) of General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
            <p>Shop Sync may also collect information when you open email messages from Shop Sync customer support service or click on links within those email messages.</p>
            <h3>2.3. Tracking website and in-app activity</h3>
            <p>Shop Sync will track your activity at the Shop Sync website and through Shop Sync cloud-based Service in order to improve the efficiency of Shop Sync user support in the event you need any help or advice on using Shop Sync Service and to be able to provide Service.</p>
            <p>Shop Sync tracks user activity and behavior at Shop Sync, and through Shop Sync cloud-based Service every time you access the website and use Shop Sync Service, and analyzes product adoption and product usage statistics using automated means. This data are used to provide user support if you need any help or advice during usage of the Shop Sync cloud-based Service.</p>
            <p>The legal basis for processing, in this case, is Shop Sync's legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) of General Data Protection Regulation which consists of securing suitable communication between us and also the performance of a contract to which you are a party under Art. 6(1)(b). As you agreed with terms and conditions, Shop Sync committed to providing Service, including support, for this reason, Shop Sync processes the above-mentioned information. Thus, Shop Sync may record your activity and use other tools because it is necessary for the purposes of providing an information service that is specifically requested by you.</p>
