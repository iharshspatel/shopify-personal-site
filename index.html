          I assist merchants in
          <strong>building and optimizing their own Shopify apps</strong>,
          helping them grow and scale their businesses.
        </li>

        <li>
          Over the past few years, I’ve worked with
          <strong>20+ Shopify agencies</strong>, learning the ins and outs of
          eCommerce. Through this, I’ve realized that
          <strong>the devil is in the details</strong>, and small improvements
          can have a huge impact on a merchant's success.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every time a merchant earns more revenue through my services, I feel a
          sense of pride in the role I've played in their growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          My goal is to make a <strong>massive impact</strong> within the
          Shopify ecosystem by developing apps that help merchants achieve
          greater reach, boost conversions, and increase their revenue.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m also focused on growing within the
          <strong>Shopify developer community</strong>, sharing knowledge,
          collaborating, and learning from others.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m currently building an <strong>SEO app</strong> to help Shopify
          merchants improve their rankings, save time, and streamline their
          workflows.
